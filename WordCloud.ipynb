This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary."

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This book was written primarily for students of forestry to whom\r\n",
      "a knowledge of the technical properties of wood is essential.\r\n",
      "The mechanics involved is reduced to the simplest terms and\r\n",
      "without reference to higher mathematics, with which the students\r\n",
      "rarely are familiar. The intention throughout has been to avoid\r\n",
      "all unnecessarily technical language and descriptions, thereby\r\n",
      "making the subject-matter readily available to every one\r\n",
      "interested in wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Part I is devoted to a discussion of the mechanical properties\r\n",
      "of wood--the relation of wood material to stresses and strains.\r\n",
      "Much of the subject-matter is merely elementary mechanics of\r\n",
      "materials in general, though written with reference to wood in\r\n",
      "particular. Numerous tables are included, showing the various\r\n",
      "strength values of many of the more important American woods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Part II deals with the factors affecting the mechanical\r\n",
      "properties of wood. This is a subject of interest to all who are\r\n",
      "concerned in the rational use of wood, and to the forester it\r\n",
      "also, by retrospection, suggests ways and means of regulating\r\n",
      "his forest product through control of the conditions of\r\n",
      "production. Attempt has been made, in the light of all data at\r\n",
      "hand, to answer many moot questions, such as the effect on the\r\n",
      "quality of wood of rate of growth, season of cutting, heartwood\r\n",
      "and sapwood, locality of growth, weight, water content,\r\n",
      "steaming, and defects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Part III describes methods of timber testing. They are for the\r\n",
      "most part those followed by the U.S. Forest Service. In schools\r\n",
      "equipped with the necessary machinery the instructions will\r\n",
      "serve to direct the tests; in others a study of the text with\r\n",
      "reference to the illustrations should give an adequate\r\n",
      "conception of the methods employed in this most important line\r\n",
      "of research.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The appendix contains a copy of the working plan followed by the\r\n",
      "U.S. Forest Service in the extensive investigations covering the\r\n",
      "mechanical properties of the woods grown in the United States.\r\n",
      "It contains many valuable suggestions for the independent\r\n",
      "investigator. In addition four tables of strength values for\r\n",
      "structural timbers, both green and air-seasoned, are included.\r\n",
      "The relation of the stresses developed in different structural\r\n",
      "forms to those developed in the small clear specimens is given.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the bibliography attempt was made to list all of the\r\n",
      "important publications and articles on the mechanical properties\r\n",
      "of wood, and timber testing. While admittedly incomplete, it\r\n",
      "should prove of assistance to the student who desires a fuller\r\n",
      "knowledge of the subject than is presented here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The writer is indebted to the U.S. Forest Service for nearly all\r\n",
      "of his tables and photographs as well as many of the data upon\r\n",
      "which the book is based, since only the Government is able to\r\n",
      "conduct the extensive investigations essential to a thorough\r\n",
      "understanding of the subject. More than eighty thousand tests\r\n",
      "have been made at the Madison laboratory alone, and the work is\r\n",
      "far from completion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The writer also acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. Emanuel\r\n",
      "Fritz, M.E., M.F., for many helpful suggestions in the\r\n",
      "preparation of Part I; and especially to Mr. Harry Donald\r\n",
      "Tiemann, M.E., M.F., engineer in charge of Timber Physics at the\r\n",

      "Study of the mechanical properties of a material is concerned\r\n",
      "mostly with its behavior in relation to stresses and strains,\r\n",
      "and the factors affecting this behavior. A ~stress~ is a\r\n",
      "distributed force and may be defined as the mutual action (1) of\r\n",
      "one body upon another, or (2) of one part of a body upon another\r\n",
      "part. In the first case the stress is _external_; in the other\r\n",
      "_internal_. The same stress may be internal from one point of\r\n",
      "view and external from another. An external force is always\r\n",
      "balanced by the internal stresses when the body is in\r\n",
      "equilibrium.\r\n",

      "If no external forces act upon a body its particles assume\r\n",
      "certain relative positions, and it has what is called its\r\n",

      "applied the natural shape and size will be changed. This\r\n",
      "distortion or deformation of the material is known as the\r\n",
      "~strain~. Every stress produces a corresponding strain, and\r\n",
      "within a certain limit (see _elastic limit_, in FUNDAMENTAL\r\n",
      "CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITIONS, above) the strain is directly\r\n",

      "of stress, however, does not produce the same strain in\r\n",
      "different materials or in different qualities of the same\r\n",

      "There are various ways in which beams are loaded, of which the\r\n",
      "following are the most important:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(1) ~Uniform load~ occurs where the load is spread evenly over\r\n",
      "the beam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(2) ~Concentrated load~ occurs where the load is applied at\r\n",
      "single point or points.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(3) ~Live~ or ~immediate load~ is one of momentary or short\r\n",
      "duration at any one point, such as occurs in crossing a bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(4) ~Dead~ or ~permanent load~ is one of constant and\r\n",
      "indeterminate duration, as books on a shelf. In the case of a\r\n",
      "bridge the weight of the structure itself is the dead load. All\r\n",
      "large beams support a uniform dead load consisting of their own\r\n",
      "weight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of dead load on a wooden beam may be two or more\r\n",
      "times that produced by an immediate load of the same weight.\r\n",
      "Loads greater than the elastic limit are unsafe and will\r\n",
      "generally result in rupture if continued long enough. A beam may\r\n",
      "be considered safe under permanent load when the deflections\r\n",
      "diminish during equal successive periods of time. A continual\r\n",
      "increase in deflection indicates an unsafe load which is almost\r\n",
      "certain to rupture the beam eventually.\r\n",

      "Variations in the humidity of the surrounding air influence the\r\n",
      "deflection of dry wood under dead load, and increased\r\n",
      "deflections during damp weather are cumulative and not recovered\r\n",
      "by subsequent drying. In the case of longleaf pine, dry beams\r\n",
      "may with safety be loaded permanently to within three-fourths of\r\n",
      "their elastic limit as determined from ordinary static tests.\r\n",
      "Increased moisture content, due to greater humidity of the air,\r\n",

      "When a dead load not great enough to rupture a beam has been\r\n",

      "To understand the effect of variations in the rate of growth it\r\n",
      "is first necessary to know how wood is formed. A tree increases\r\n",
      "in diameter by the formation, between the old wood and the inner\r\n",
      "bark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living\r\n",
      "branches, and roots. Under ordinary conditions one layer is\r\n",
      "formed each year and in cross section as on the end of a log\r\n",
      "they appear as rings--often spoken of as _annual rings_. These\r\n",
      "growth layers are made up of wood cells of various kinds, but\r\n",
      "for the most part fibrous. In timbers like pine, spruce,\r\n",
      "hemlock, and other coniferous or softwood species the wood cells\r\n",
      "are mostly of one kind, and as a result the material is much\r\n",
      "more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods. (See\r\n",
      "Frontispiece.) There are no vessels or pores in coniferous wood\r\n",
      "such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.\r\n",
      "(See Fig. 22.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "less filled with vessels, in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash)\r\n",
      "quite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, gum) too\r\n",
      "small to be seen plainly without a small hand lens. In\r\n",
      "discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two\r\n",
      "large classes--_ring-porous_ and _diffuse-porous_. (See Fig.\r\n",
      "22.) In ring-porous species, such as oak, chestnut, ash, black\r\n",
      "locust, catalpa, mulberry, hickory, and elm, the larger vessels\r\n",
      "or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) become\r\n",
      "localized in one part of the growth ring, thus forming a region\r\n",
      "of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring is\r\n",
      "made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood\r\n",
      "fibres. These fibres are the elements which give strength and\r\n",
      "toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In diffuse-porous woods the pores are scattered throughout the\r\n",
      "growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.\r\n",
      "Examples of this kind of wood are gum, yellow poplar, birch,\r\n",
      "maple, cottonwood, basswood, buckeye, and willow. Some species,\r\n",
      "such as walnut and cherry, are on the border between the two\r\n",
      "classes, forming a sort of intermediate group.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If one examines the smoothly cut end of a stick of almost any\r\n",
      "kind of wood, he will note that each growth ring is made up of\r\n",
      "two more or less well-defined parts. That originally nearest the\r\n",
      "centre of the tree is more open textured and almost invariably\r\n",
      "lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring.\r\n",
      "The inner portion was formed early in the season, when growth\r\n",
      "was comparatively rapid and is known as _early wood_ (also\r\n",

      "produced in the summer or early fall. In soft pines there is not\r\n",
      "much contrast in the different parts of the ring, and as a\r\n",
      "result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work.\r\n",
      "In hard pine, on the other hand, the late wood is very dense and\r\n",
      "is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft,\r\n",
      "straw-colored early wood. (See Fig. 23.) In ring-porous woods\r\n",
      "each season's growth is always well defined, because the large\r\n",
      "pores of the spring abut on the denser tissue of the fall\r\n",
      "before. In the diffuse-porous, the demarcation between rings is\r\n",
      "not always so clear and in not a few cases is almost, if not\r\n",
